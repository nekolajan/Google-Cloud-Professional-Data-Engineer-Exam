Question 1
Every employee of your company has a Google account. Your operational team needs to manage a large number of instances on Compute Engine. 
Each member of this team needs only administrative access to the servers. 
Your security team wants to ensure that the deployment of credentials is operationally efficient and must be able to determine who accessed a given instance. 
What should you do?
A. Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the public key in the metadata of each instance.
B. Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to send you their public key. Use a configuration management tool to deploy those keys on each instance.
C. Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to add the public key to their Google account. Grant the ג€compute.osAdminLoginג€ role to the Google group corresponding to this team.
D. Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the public key as a project-wide public SSH key in your Cloud Platform project and allow project-wide public SSH keys on each instance.

Question 2 
You need to create a custom VPC with a single subnet. The subnet's range must be as large as possible. 
Which range should you use?
A. 0.0.0.0/0
B. 10.0.0.0/8
C. 172.16.0.0/12
D. 192.168.0.0/16

Correct Answer: B
In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), when creating a VPC network, you should use the IP ranges that are reserved for private networks as defined by the RFC 1918. Here are the private IP address ranges defined by RFC 1918:

10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)
From the provided options:

A. 0.0.0.0/0: This is not a private IP address range. It represents all possible IP addresses.

B. 10.0.0.0/8: This is a private IP range that covers all IP addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255. It's the largest range among the options.

C. 172.16.0.0/12: This is a private IP range, but it's smaller than 10.0.0.0/8.

D. 192.168.0.0/16: This is also a private IP range, but it's smaller than both B and C.

Question 4
You want to configure autohealing for network load balancing for a group of Compute Engine instances that run in multiple zones, using the fewest possible steps.
You need to configure re-creation of VMs if they are unresponsive after 3 attempts of 10 seconds each. What should you do?
A. Create an HTTP load balancer with a backend configuration that references an existing instance group. Set the health check to healthy (HTTP)
B. Create an HTTP load balancer with a backend configuration that references an existing instance group. Define a balancing mode and set the maximum RPS to 10.
C. Create a managed instance group. Set the Autohealing health check to healthy (HTTP)
D. Create a managed instance group. Verify that the autoscaling setting is on.
